# Contributing to scripts
## Contribution Guidelines
 - Open an issue first to comment about problems or suggested changes
    The issues do not need to follow any specific formatting aside being readable in plaintext, feel free to go as in depth or as shallow as you'd like.
 - Pull Requests
    PRs should only be opened after issues, they'll be verified accordingly and if it is acceptable, the PR will be merged and the relevant issue closed.

## Coding Guidelines
  1. Shell scripts must follow POSIX, and have `#!/bin/sh` appropriately. (Test with the dash shell if possible).
  2. Shell scripts that do not follow POSIX must have `#!/bin/bash` and have bash compatibility.
  3. Python scripts must follow PEP8.
